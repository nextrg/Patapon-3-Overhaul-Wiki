## Making pages
To make a page, you have to make a new .txt file (its name will be the page name) inside Pages folder and mention it in <b>pagelist.js</b> by adding the location (local) in array. Once done, do a pull request.
## Syntax
To make titles, use ```<header>Title</header>```, for page names.<br>
To make chapters, use ```<chapter>Chapter</chapter>```.<br>
HTML and CSS use is allowed, but don't excessively use it.
